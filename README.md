This project classifies animal sounds using audio spectrograms and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. It reads `.wav` audio files, extracts spectrogram features using STFT, and applies preprocessing and PCA for dimensionality reduction. The processed data is then used to train an SVM model for classifying audio into one of 10 animal classes. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using accuracy and classification reports. Finally, it displays an image corresponding to the predicted animal label.
